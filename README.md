你好！
很冒昧用这样的方式来和你沟通，如有打扰请忽略我的提交哈。我是光年实验室（gnlab.com）的HR，在招Golang开发工程师，我们是一个技术型团队，技术氛围非常好。全职和兼职都可以，不过最好是全职，工作地点杭州。
我们公司是做流量增长的，Golang负责开发SAAS平台的应用，我们做的很多应用是全新的，工作非常有挑战也很有意思，是国内很多大厂的顾问。
如果有兴趣的话加我微信：13515810775  ，也可以访问 https://gnlab.com/，联系客服转发给HR。

# Vuvuzela

Vuvuzela is a messaging system that protects the privacy of message contents
and message metadata.  Users communicating through Vuvuzela do not reveal who
they are talking to, even in the presence of powerful nation-state adversaries.
Our [SOSP 2015 paper](https://davidlazar.org/papers/vuvuzela.pdf) explains
the system, its threat model, performance, limitations, and more.  Our
[SOSP 2015 slides](https://davidlazar.org/slides/vuvuzela-sosp2015.pdf) give
a more graphical overview of the system.

Vuvuzela is the first system that provides strong metadata privacy while
scaling to millions of users.  Previous systems that hide metadata using
Tor (such as [Pond](https://pond.imperialviolet.org/)) are prone to traffic
analysis attacks.  Systems that encrypt metadata using techniques like
DC-nets and PIR don't scale beyond thousands of users.

Vuvuzela uses efficient cryptography ([NaCl](http://nacl.cr.yp.to)) to hide as
much metadata as possible and adds noise to metadata that can't be encrypted
efficiently.  This approach provides less privacy than encrypting all of the
metadata, but it enables Vuvuzela to support millions of users.  Nonetheless,
Vuvuzela adds enough noise to thwart adversaries like the NSA and guarantees
[differential privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy) for
users' metadata.

In practice, the message latency would be around 20s to 40s, depending
on security parameters and the number of users connected to the system.

Vuvuzela is unable to encrypt two kinds of metadata: the number of idle users
(connected users without a conversation partner) and the number of active users
(users engaged in a conversation).  Without noise, a sophisticated adversary
could use this metadata to learn who is talking to who.  However, the Vuvuzela
servers generate noise that perturbs this metadata so that it is difficult to
exploit.
